%DATA_PARTITION Partition the whole sample set params.Y into P1 and P2. P1
%with samples Y1 for sampling u and v. The other is for estimation. The
%size of P1 and P2 is pre-specified but depends on some required orders of
%the algorithm. 

% NOTE: Partitioning is only for analysis. In practice, it may be unnecessary.
% We can use the same set for sampling and calculate covariance matrix

% Devide training set into 2 sets P1 and P2

% Randomly pick p1 samples from Y
P1 = randperm(p, p1);

% The rest is for fresh samples
